# Genereting different icon sizes from your logo

### Usage - Easy Mode (recommended)

With Easy Mode, the tool supports generating all the icon and splash assets you need for iOS, Android, and PWA from a single logo file along with an optional dark mode logo, and background colors. This is the easiest way to generate all your assets, but it trades customizability for convenience.

To use this mode, create a single `logo.png` or `icon.png` with an optional `logo-dark.png` in `assets/` (the tool also supports using SVG files as source images, substitue `.svg` as needed):

```
assets/
├── logo.png
└── logo-dark.png
```

Then, generate the assets:

```shell
npx @capacitor/assets generate
```

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";
