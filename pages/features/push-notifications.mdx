# Firebase Push Notifications

<Callout type="warning">
  **Before you continue:** Make sure you've completed the [Firebase
  Authentication](./authorization) tutorial first. It walks you through creating
  a Firebase project and setting up your iOS/Android apps ‚Äî which is required
  for push notifications to work.
</Callout>

## ‚ú® Step 1: Set up your Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

Make sure you:

- Have **Firebase Messaging** enabled in your Firebase project.
- Downloaded the **service account JSON file** from Firebase Console
  - Navigate to `Project Settings ‚Üí Service Accounts`
  - Click `Generate new private key`
  - Place it in `services/firebase/` and rename if needed

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Step 2: Test sending push notifications manually

Use the prebuilt `sendFcmMessage(fcmMessage)` function:

```ts
await sendFcmMessage({
  message: {
    token: "<device-fcm-token>",
    notification: {
      title: "New Message",
      body: "You've got mail üöÄ",
    },
  },
});
```

This function handles:

- Authenticating with Firebase via service account
- Sending a POST request to the [FCM endpoint](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/send-message)

---

## üì° Step 3: Request push permissions (on device)

This is already handled via:

```ts
checkAndRequestPermissionsForPushNotifications();
```

You can also do it manually:

```ts
await checkPermissions();
await requestPermissions();
```

---

## üéÆ Step 4: Get and update FCM token

Tokens are generated per device. You need to:

```ts
await updateFcmToken(user);
```

This will:

- Request FCM token
- Send it to your API (`/user/update-fcm-token`) along with user info

---

## üöÄ Step 5: Listen to notifications

These listeners are pre-written for you. You just need to enable them:

```ts
addNotificationReceivedListener();
addNotificationActionPerformedListener();
```

If needed:

```ts
addTokenReceivedListener();
getDeliveredNotifications();
```

---

## üö´ Remove listeners when done

```ts
removeAllListeners();
```

This is useful to clean up when user logs out or app closes.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- If messages are not delivered:

  - Make sure token is valid
  - Check Firebase Console > Logs
  - Verify service account has **Firebase Admin SDK** enabled

- If your token changes, make sure to update it again via `updateFcmToken()`

---

## üîÑ Next steps

- Trigger push messages from your server (e.g. when new message arrives)
- Add topic-based notifications if needed
- Customize notification appearance with images and actions
