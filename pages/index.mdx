# Get Started with NextNative

### Hey, builder ðŸ‘‹

Here's a quick guide to get your project up and start shipping awesome mobile apps with NextNative fast.

## Clone and install

1. In your terminal, run the following commands **one-by-one**:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lite1pal/nextnative_boilerplate.git [YOUR_APP_NAME]

cd [YOUR_APP_NAME]

npm i

git remote remove origin

mv .env.example .env.local
```

<Callout type="info">
  **NextNative** requires Node 20 or greater. Type node -v in your terminal to
  check version.
</Callout>

Now make sure your [environment is set up](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/environment-setup)
for the iOS and Android platforms you will be building for.

Here are the essentials:

### iOS requiments

1.  To build iOS apps with NextNative, youâ€™ll need macOS. While tools like Ionic Appflow offer cloud builds, having a Mac is strongly recommended for proper testing.

To get started, you need to install the next:

```txt
	â€¢	Xcode (via the App Store, version 16.0+ required)
	â€¢	Xcode Command Line Tools (xcode-select --install)
	â€¢	Homebrew
	â€¢	Cocoapods
```

#### Xcode

You can install Xcode by using the [Apple App Store](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835%3Fmt%3D12&ved=2ahUKEwib2urfodyMAxXKJxAIHWbUIrMQFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2fEvMbfRtGhB4SPHYB54NX) on your Mac.

But don't worry, you're going to build everything in your favorite IDE. Xcode is needed to run an emulator.

#### CocoaPods

To run an iOS app in Xcode emulators, you need CocoaPods.

Check whether you have already them installed:

```shell
pod --version
```

If not, then install them with homebrew:

```shell
brew install cocoapods
```

<Callout type="info">
  Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you don't have it.
</Callout>

<br />

### Android requirements

You need to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and Android SDK

<Callout type="info">
  If you have a mac M1-M4, I recommend downloading [Android Studio Ladybug
  October 2024](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive) release. It's way
  more stable and has less cache bugs.
