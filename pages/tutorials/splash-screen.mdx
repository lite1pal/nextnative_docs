# Customize Splash Screen in iOS & Android with Capacitor

First impressions matter, and a clean splash screen makes your app feel professional right from the start.

With NextNative and Capacitor, adding a native and animated splash screen is super easy. Letâ€™s walk through it.

<br />
import Image from "next/image";

<Image
  src="/docs/splash-screen.gif"
  alt="Splash screen"
  width={400}
  height={400}
  style={{ borderRadius: "16px" }}
/>

The splash screen is the first thing users see when launching your app. NextNative provides both a native splash screen (using Capacitor) and a custom in-app splash screen for a smooth transition.

### Native Splash Screen

The native splash screen is managed by Capacitor and appears instantly when the app launches. You can customize it in the `assets/` folder and [generate](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/splash-screens-and-icons) platform-specific assets using the Capacitor CLI.

### In-App Splash Screen

The in-app splash screen takes over after the native splash screen and provides a smoother transition to your app:

```tsx
// app/(mobile)/components/SplashScreen.tsx
import React from "react";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

const SplashScreen = () => {
  return (
    <motion.div
      className="fixed inset-0 z-50 overflow-hidden bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 via-blue-600 to-blue-700"
      initial={{ opacity: 1 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 0 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: 1.5 }}
      style={{ pointerEvents: "none" }}
    >
      <DefaultLogo />
    </motion.div>
  );
};

export default SplashScreen;
```

This component uses Framer Motion for smooth animations. The `DefaultLogo` is a simple SVG animation, but **you can replace it with your own logo**.

### Managing the Splash Screen

NextNative provides a custom hook to manage the splash screen:

```tsx
// app/(mobile)/hooks/useSplashScreen.tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { SplashScreen as SplashScreenPlugin } from "@capacitor/splash-screen";

export const useSplashScreen = () => {
  const [showSplash, setShowSplash] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const hideSplash = async () => {
      await SplashScreenPlugin.hide();
      setTimeout(() => {
        setShowSplash(false);
      }, 2000);
    };
    hideSplash();
  }, []);

  return { showSplash };
};
```

This hook:

1. Handles the native Capacitor splash screen
2. Controls the visibility of the in-app splash screen
3. Returns a `showSplash` boolean to conditionally render the splash screen

### Using the Splash Screen in Your App

To use the splash screen in your app, import the hook and component in your router:

```tsx
// app/(mobile)/router.tsx
import { useSplashScreen } from "@/app/(mobile)/hooks/useSplashScreen";
import SplashScreen from "@/app/(mobile)/components/SplashScreen";

const AppRouter = () => {
  const { showSplash } = useSplashScreen();

  return (
    <IonApp>
      {showSplash && <SplashScreen />}
      {/* Rest of your app */}
    </IonApp>
  );
};
```
