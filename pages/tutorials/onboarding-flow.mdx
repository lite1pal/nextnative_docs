## Onboarding Flow

Onboarding helps users understand your app's value and functionality. NextNative provides a customizable onboarding flow with smooth transitions.

### Onboarding Screen Component

The `OnboardingScreen` component displays a series of slides and manages navigation between them:

```tsx
// Simplified version of app/(mobile)/components/OnboardingScreen.tsx
const OnboardingScreen: React.FC<OnboardingScreenProps> = ({ onComplete }) => {
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);
  const [direction, setDirection] = useState(0);
  const [isExiting, setIsExiting] = useState(false);

  // Navigation functions and animations
  // ...

  return (
    <motion.div className="fixed inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 via-blue-600 to-blue-700">
      {/* Skip button */}
      {/* Slide content with animations */}
      {/* Progress dots and next/done button */}
    </motion.div>
  );
};
```

### OnboardInitializer Component

The `OnboardInitializer` component manages whether to show the onboarding flow or the main app:

```tsx
// app/(mobile)/components/OnboardInitializer.tsx
const AppInitializer: React.FC<AppInitializerProps> = ({ children }) => {
  const [onboardingCompleted, setOnboardingCompleted] = useState(false);
  const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const initializeApp = async () => {
      // Check if onboarding has been completed before
      const onboardingStatus = await Preferences.get({
        key: "onboardingCompleted10",
      });
      setOnboardingCompleted(onboardingStatus.value === "true");
      setIsInitialized(true);
    };
    initializeApp();
  }, []);

  const handleOnboardingComplete = async () => {
    await Preferences.set({ key: "onboardingCompleted10", value: "true" });
    setOnboardingCompleted(true);
  };

  if (!isInitialized) return null;

  if (!onboardingCompleted) {
    return <OnboardingScreen onComplete={handleOnboardingComplete} />;
  }

  return <>{children}</>;
};
```

This component:

1. Checks if the user has completed onboarding before
2. Shows the onboarding screen if it's the first time
3. Renders the main app if onboarding is completed

### Using the Onboarding Flow

To use the onboarding flow, wrap your app with the `OnboardInitializer`:

```tsx
// app/(mobile)/router.tsx
import OnboardInitializer from "@/app/(mobile)/components/OnboardInitializer";

const AppRouter = () => {
  const { showSplash } = useSplashScreen();

  return (
    <IonApp>
      {showSplash && <SplashScreen />}
      <OnboardInitializer>
        {/* Your main app */}
        <IonReactRouter>{/* Routes */}</IonReactRouter>
      </OnboardInitializer>
    </IonApp>
  );
};
```

## Customizing the Onboarding Content

The onboarding slides are defined as an array of objects:

```tsx
const onboardingSlides = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Welcome!",
    description: "Discover the amazing features of our app.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Connect Seamlessly",
    description: "Stay in touch with friends and colleagues effortlessly.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Get Started",
    description: "You're all set to explore. Let's dive in!",
  },
];
```

To customize the onboarding content:

1. Edit the titles and descriptions
2. Add more slides if needed
3. Customize the background color or gradient
4. Add images or illustrations to each slide

## Customizing the Splash Screen

To customize your splash screen:

1. Replace the `DefaultLogo` component with your own logo
2. Adjust the animation timing and transitions
3. Change the background color or gradient
4. Add additional animations or elements

NextNative includes several pre-made splash screen logos that you can use:

- `DefaultLogo`
- `SpinningStar`
- `PulsingSpiral`
- `FoldingTriangles`
- `Swoosh`
- `AppleBite`
- `XCross`

Simply import and use them in your SplashScreen component.

## Best Practices

- **Keep onboarding brief**: Limit to 3-4 screens highlighting key features
- **Make it skippable**: Always provide an option to skip
- **Test with real users**: Ensure your flow is intuitive
- **Consider accessibility**: Make sure your splash screen and onboarding work well with screen readers
- **Optimize animations**: Keep animations smooth and lightweight

## Conclusion

A well-designed splash screen and onboarding flow can significantly improve your app's first impression and user retention. NextNative's built-in components make it easy to create a polished experience that guides users into your app seamlessly.
