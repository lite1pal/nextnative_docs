# Ship in 5 minutes

Let's get your mobile app running in 5 minutes ⚡️

We're going to use a production-ready template messenger app that I've included.

> This guide shows how to preview the app on a simulator and start building your own features right away.

## 1. Prerequisite: Get Started

If you haven’t already, complete the [Get Started](/) tutorial first. It sets up everything under the hood — Capacitor, Next.js, Ionic, and Firebase.

---

## 2. Run Mobile Dev Server

Use this command to start your mobile app in **live reload mode** — it handles:

- Static builds
- Watching changes
- Reloading updates

```bash
npm run mobile:dev
```

It starts a local server with [Live Reload](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/live-reload), to which a mobile app will be connected.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout>
  When you're ready to ship the production build to the App Store or Google Play, run:

`npm run mobile`

Then follow the [Preparing for deployment guide](https://docs.nextnative.dev/preparing-for-deployment/rename-your-app).

## 3. Open in Xcode

To launch the iOS app in a simulator:

```shell
npx cap open ios
```

Or simply open Xcode yourself and choose the **nextnative/ios** folder.

## 4. Run the Simulator

Click the ▶️ Run button in Xcode to boot your app.

import Image from "next/image";

<br />

<Image
  src="/run-emulator-xcode.gif"
  alt="Run an emulator in Xcode"
  width={300}
  height={300}
/>

🕓 The first build might take a bit longer — Xcode will compile and set up your project.

✅ All future reloads will be much faster.

## 5. You’re Live! 🚀

That’s it, you’ve got a native mobile app running with Next.js in just a few minutes.

Go ahead and start building your own features:

<br />
<Image
  src="/ship-in-5-minutes.gif"
  alt="Ship in 5 minutes"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>
