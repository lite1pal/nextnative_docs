# Ship in 5 minutes

Let's get your mobile app running in 5 minutes ⚡️

We're going to use a production-ready messenger app that I've included.

1. If you haven't already, follow first the [Get Started](/) tutorial.

2. Run a mobile app in dev mode. This command handles all the heavy lifting for you by statically building all code, enabling live reload, and many more!

```shell
npm run mobile:dev
```

It starts a local server with Live Reload, to which a mobile app will be connected.

3. Create a new terminal window and run this command to open Xcode with path of your project:

```shell
npx cap open ios
```

Or simply open Xcode yourself.

4. Run an emulator in Xcode:

import Image from "next/image";

<Image
  src="/run-emulator-xcode.gif"
  alt="Run an emulator in Xcode"
  width={300}
  height={300}
/>

Initial launch of an app in the emulator might take some time because it builds everything.

Next times are going to be much faster.

5. That's it. Next step is to build your app's unique features!

  alt="Ship in 5 minutes"
  width={400}
  height={400}
/>
