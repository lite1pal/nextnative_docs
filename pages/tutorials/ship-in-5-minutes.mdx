# Ship in 5 minutes

Let's get your mobile app running **in 5 minutes** ⚡️

We're going to use a production-ready template messenger app that I've included.

### 1. Prerequisite

<Callout type="warning">
  If you haven’t already, complete the [Get Started](/) tutorial first.
</Callout>

---

### 2. Run a mobile dev server

Use this command to start your mobile app in development mode. It handles:

- Static builds
- Next.js API support
- Watching changes
- Reloading updates

```bash
npm run mobile:dev
```

It starts a local server with [Live Reload](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/live-reload), to which a mobile app will be connected.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout>
  When you're ready to ship the production build to the App Store or Google Play, run:

`npm run mobile`

Then follow the [Preparing for deployment](https://docs.nextnative.dev/preparing-for-deployment/rename-your-app) guide.

</Callout>

## iOS

### 1. Open in Xcode

To launch the iOS app in a simulator:

```shell
npx cap open ios
```

Or simply open Xcode yourself and choose the **nextnative/ios/App/App.xcworkspace** file.

### 2. Run the Simulator

Click the ▶️ Run button in Xcode to boot your app.

import Image from "next/image";

<br />

<Image
  src="/run-emulator-xcode.gif"
  alt="Run an emulator in Xcode"
  width={500}
  height={500}
  style={{ borderRadius: "16px" }}
/>

🕓 The first build might take a bit longer — Xcode will compile and set up your project.

✅ All future reloads will be much faster.

## Android

<Callout type="info">
  If you don't need Firebase Auth/Notifications in your app at all,
  go to **build.gradle** and remove this line:

```
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

Then skip to [Step 5](/tutorials/ship-in-5-minutes#4-rerun-a-mobile-dev-server).

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  [Rename your app](../preparing-for-deployment/rename-your-app) before setting
  up Firebase for Android.
</Callout>

### 1. Add a new Android app on Firebase

In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com):

1. Click **Add App** → Select **Android**
2. Enter your app’s **Package name** (e.g. `com.yourcompany.appname`)
3. (Optional) Add app nickname
4. Click **Register app**

---

### 2. Download & place config file

1. Download the `google-services.json` file
2. Place it in:

```bash
android/app/google-services.json
```

### 3. Edit build.gradle

<Callout type="warning">
  **It's already done** in the latest update of NextNative, so if you have the
  latest version pulled, no need to do this.
</Callout>

Go to **android/app/build.gradle** and replace these lines:

```gradle
try {
    def servicesJSON = file('google-services.json')
    if (servicesJSON.text) {
        apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
    }
} catch(Exception e) {
    logger.info("google-services.json not found, google-services plugin not applied. Push Notifications won't work")
}
```

with only this one line:

```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

### 4. Rerun a mobile dev server

```bash
npm run mobile:dev
```

### 5. Open in Android Studio

To launch an Android app in an emulator or a real device:

```shell
npx cap open android
```

Or simply open Android Studio yourself and choose the **nextnative/ios** folder.

### 6. Run

Click the ▶️ Run button in Android Studio to boot your app.

<Callout type="info">
  Run your app on a real Android phone.
  <br /> <br /> It’s the only way to test native Google login reliably on a Mac
  M1/M2 and many Windows PCs. <br /> <br /> If you don't have an Android phone,
  no worries, you can test everything in a browser. But it's recommended to test
  on a real device before publishing an app.
