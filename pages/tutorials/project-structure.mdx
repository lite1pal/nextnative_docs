# Project Structure

The NextNative project structure follows a consistent organization to help you navigate and build your application effectively.

## Root Directory

- `app/` - Contains the main application code, pages, and components. You'll be working inside of it 99% of your time.
- `assets/` - Static assets like images and fonts. Learn more [here](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/splash-screens-and-icons).
- `db/` - Database-related files
- `icons/` - Icon components and assets that [were generated](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/splash-screens-and-icons) from `assets/` folder.
- `ios/` and `android/` - Native platform-specific code
- `lib/` - Utility functions and shared code
- `prisma/` - Prisma ORM configuration and schema
- `public/` - Static files served directly
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `services/` - API services and external integrations
- `storage/` - Storage utilities

## App Directory

The `app/` directory uses Next.js App Router architecture and contains platform-specific code:

- `(mobile)/` - Contains cross-platform components and pages that will be statically generated with Next.js's `output: export`. Uses IonicRouter to create native-like animated transitions for mobile navigation.
- `(web)/` - Contains the web landing page to market your app and web-specific components that are server-side rendered and use Next.js routing.
- `api/` - Next.js API routes
- `i18n/` - Internationalization files and configuration
- `globals.css` - Global CSS styles
- `layout.tsx` - Root layout component that wraps all pages
- `page.tsx` - Main entry page of the application. By default, it imports the cross-platform code. If you need to have a landing page in a single codebase, follow [this tutorial]().
- `not-found.tsx` - Custom 404 error page
- `opengraph-image.png` - Default Open Graph image for social sharing
- `favicon.ico` - Website favicon

## Configuration Files

- `capacitor.config.ts` - Capacitor configuration for native apps
- `config.ts` - Application configuration
- `next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `.env` - Environment variables (use `.env.example` as a template)
